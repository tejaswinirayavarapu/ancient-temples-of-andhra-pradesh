                        The temple is dedicated to Venkateswara, a form of Vishnu, who is believed to have appeared on earth to save mankind from trials and troubles of Kali Yuga.
                        Hence the place is also known by the name Kaliyuga Vaikuntha and the deity here is referred to as Kaliyuga Prathyaksha Daivam.
                        The temple is also known by other names like Tirumala Temple, Tirupati Temple and Tirupati Balaji Temple.
                        Venkateswara is also known by other names including Balaji, Govinda, and Srinivasa. The temple is run by Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD),
                        which is under control of Andhra Pradesh Government. The head of TTD is appointed by Andhra Pradesh Government.
                        Tirumala hills are part of Seshachalam Hills range. The hills are 853 metres (2,799 ft) above sea level and comprise seven peaks,
                        representing the seven heads of Adisesha. The temple lies on the seventh peakâ€”Venkatadri, on the southern banks of Sri Swami Pushkarini, a holy water tank.
                        Hence the temple is also referred to as "Temple of Seven Hills". Tirumala town covers an area of about 10.33 sq mi (26.75 km2).

                    <p class="detailed-view-card-description">
                        Srisailam holds great religious importance for followers of both Shaivism and Shaktism, two major sects within Hinduism.
                        This sacred site is home to a revered temple that is recognized as one of the twelve Jyotirlingasâ€”holy shrines where Lord Shiva is worshipped in the form of a radiant lingam.
                        At the same time, it is also considered one of the eighteen Shakti Peethas, which are powerful centers dedicated to the worship of the Hindu goddess.
                        In this temple, Lord Shiva is worshipped as Mallikarjuna, while his consort, Goddess Parvati, is honored as Bhramaramba.
                        According to legend, Shiva and Parvati once set out to find suitable brides for their sons, Ganesha and Kartikeya.
                        Ganesha was married to Riddhi (symbolizing intellect) and Siddhi (symbolizing spiritual power).
                        When Kartikeya returned and learned of this, he became upset and chose to live alone on Mount Krauncha in Palani, adopting the name Kumara Brahmachari.
                        When Shiva tried to console him, Kartikeya attempted to leave again, but the gods (Devas) requested him to stay nearby.
                        As a result, Shiva and Parvati remained in the area, and the place where they stayed came to be known as Srisailam.
                        This story adds a deep mythological and emotional layer to the spiritual significance of the temple.

                        Sri Varasidhi Vinayaka Swamy Temple is a Hindu temple of Ganesha According to legend, there were three brothers who were mute, deaf and blind.
                        They were digging a well to fetch water to their field. The device they were using fell into the well hitting hard object.
                        When they dug further, blood started to gush out of the well and the three got rid of their disabilities.
                        The villagers rushed to the spot and found deity of Ganesha. Villagers dug further, but they were not able to find the base of the deity.
                        The deity sits in the well which is always full of water.The idol has apparently gotten larger over time.
                        This is evidenced by the fact that a silver armour of the deity from 50 year ago, doesn't fit today.
                        Currently only the knee and abdomen of the deity is visible.

                        As per the temple's legend, Vishnu manifested in this form (lion's head and human body) after saving his devotee Prahlada from a murder attempt by the latter's father Hiranyakashipu.
                        Except on Akshaya Tritiya, the idol of Varaha Narasimha is covered with sandalwood paste throughout the year, which makes it resemble a linga.
                        The temple was built in Kalingan architecture styles and stands unique in the historical region of Kalinga.
                        The present temple was built by Eastern Ganga dynasty king Narasingha Deva I in the 13th century and consecrated by his son Bhanudeva I in 1268 CE.
                        The temple was built by Akthayi Senapati, on the command of Narasingha Deva I.
